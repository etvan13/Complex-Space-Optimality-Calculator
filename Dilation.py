Welcome to the Time Dilation Simulator!
          
        Discover the intriguing effects of gravity on time through the eyes of three observers:
            1. You: Observe from a neutral point, where time flows consistently at 1 unit per second.
            2. Observer A: Moves towards gravity, experiencing time more slowly.
            3. Observer B: Moves away from gravity, where time speeds up.
        
        How It Works:
            * Move "Left": Adds gravity for Observer A, slowing their time.
            * Move "Right": Reduces gravity for Observer B, speeding up their time.
            
        Your Mission: Watch as Observer A aims for a target. Your actions influence their journey, 
            showcasing how gravity bends the fabric of time.

The Triangle of Observers:

        Imagine a triangle where each point represents one of the three observers. Initially, 
        all are at the same point—forming a perfect equilateral triangle. You're at the base, 
        Observer A is at the top left, and Observer B at the top right. Initially, all exist 
        in a state free from any relativistic effects of time dilation.

        Movement and Time Dilation:
            * Right Movement (Time at Rest): Selecting a 'right' move keeps the triangle's structure 
                intact but lets time tick uniformly for all observers. This is a pause, allowing 
                every observer to experience time at a consistent rate within their frame.
            * Left Movement (Spatial Expansion): Opting for a 'left' move makes the triangle expand. 
                Observer A heads towards a weaker gravitational field, while Observer B moves towards 
                a stronger one. This expansion is spatial—each observer drifts 1 unit per second from 
                your viewpoint, ignoring the dilation initially, but introduces the dilation effects 
                observed in the simulation (an equilateral triangle that distorts).

        Visualizing the Triangle:
            With each 'left' move, the triangle's expansion visually depicts the varying perceptions 
            of time due to gravity's relativistic impacts:

            * The side leading to Observer A, moving into stronger gravity, elongates slower, mirroring 
                their stretched time.
            * The side reaching towards Observer B, heading into lesser gravity, lengthens faster, 
                signifying their quicker passage of time from your perspective.
        
        The Observer's Perspective:
            From your position at the triangle's base, you watch the two vertices separate with each 
            'left' move. This divergence in their temporal experiences is symbolized by the triangle's 
            expansion. It acts as a metaphor for spacetime stretching under gravity's sway, influencing 
            each observer's time flow.

Understanding Physical Space and Spacetime
    
    In our journey through the relativistic effects of gravity on time, we've visualized the movement 
    of our observers as an expanding equilateral triangle in physical space. We must consider two 
    perspectives on the situation at hand. On where the triangle exists in physical space, and another 
    where the triangle exists in spacetime 'iSpace'.
    
    The Equilateral Triangle in Physical Space:
        * Unchanged Proportions: In physical space, given each frame of reference, each observer would 
            'see' the triangle as equilateral uniformly expanding with each 'left' movement. This 
            represents each observer moving symmetrically away from the starting point, maintaining equal 
            spatial relations with one another. This is true given their frame of observation.
        * Constant Spatial Movement: Despite the gravitational effects, the physical space between the 
            observers expands at a constant rate, perceived as 1 unit per second from your perspective. 
            This uniform expansion symbolizes the physical distance they cover, irrespective of the 
            relativistic time effects.
    
    The Triangle in Spacetime (iSpace): A Unified Perspective
        As the observers expand from one another, they perceive an expanding equilateral triangle 
        respective to their own gravitational context. However, each observer percieving their own clock 
        as 'normal' would visualize the other two observers as having changing rates. This divergence in 
        time perception affects how each observer views the expansion of the triangle.
        
        Spacetime: A Perspective Binding Fabric
            * Composite Frames: Spacetime serves as a canvas that merges these individual perceptions 
                into a singular, unified frame. This frame draws an equilateral triangle that accomodates 
                all frames into one, but by doing so, this triangle 'bends' inwards and outwards to 
                accomodate for each perspective.
            * Percieved Geometry: Within this unified spacetime framework, what appears as an equilateral 
                triangle in each observer's frame transforms when viewed from the comprehensive spacetime 
                perspective. The triangle's sides, representing the paths between observers, no longer 
                conform strictly to equilateral geometry due to the curvature induced by differing time 
                flows.
                    - Think of it like a strange shape. When you look at it, it looks 'normal', but when 
                        you rotate it, it's completely different than how it originally looked. It's 
                        still the same shape, just differs based on how you look at it!

        Bridging Individual Realities:
            * Relativity of Straight Lines: Ever heard "The shortest distance between two points is not 
                always a straight line"?, well this is exactly why! Just as a straight line in spacetime 
                can curve, so too can our equilateral triangle warp, accomodating the realtive nature of 
                time and space as experienced by each observer.
            * The Illusion of Equilaterality: While each observer perceives an equilateral triangle 
                expanding within their frame, the incorporation of these perspectives into the singular
                spacetime grid reveals a more complex shape, illustrating the relativistic interplay
                between space and time.

Spacetime Through the Lens of Complex Numbers

    In mathematics, complex numbers offer a way to extend the real number line by introducing an 
    imaginary component, denoted by 'i'. This concept mirrors the fabric of spacetime, where the "real" 
    part corresponds to our observable dimensions and the "imaginary" part represents the hidden 
    dimensions or effects, like time dilation, that we can't directly perceive.

    Spacetime and Complex Numbers:
    * Real Component: In the context of spacetime, the real component can be likened to the observable 
        spatial dimensions within an observer's frame. This is the part of spacetime that we can 
        directly measure and perceive.
    * Imaginary Component: The imaginary part of spacetime, akin to the imaginary unit 'i' in complex 
        numbers, symbolizes the aspects of spacetime that elude direct perception, such as the 
        curvature induced by gravity. This component accounts for the "bending" of spacetime, allowing 
        for phenomena like time dilation.

    The Scaling Quantity in Spacetime:
        * Defining Curvature: Just as the magnitude of the imaginary part in a complex number defines 
            the extent of deviation from the real axis, the "scaling quantity" in spacetime represents 
            the degree to which time and space are curved due to gravitational effects. This curvature 
            allows spacetime to "stretch" or "compress," accommodating more events or distances within 
            a given segment of the real (observable) part.
        * Storing Values Along the 'Invisible' Line: The imaginary component in complex numbers allows 
            us to represent values and operations that don't fit on the traditional real number line. 
            Similarly, the "imaginary" aspect of spacetime enables us to conceptualize how an observer 
            can traverse or experience more space or time than what appears constrained by the real 
            dimensions, like fitting 20 units of experience within a 5-unit span of observable space.

    Mathematical Insights into Relativity:
        This mathematical analogy sheds light on the intricacies of spacetime and relativity, offering 
        a way to grasp the otherwise abstract concepts of time dilation and spacetime curvature. It 
        highlights how spacetime accommodates the vast range of relativistic phenomena within a coherent 
        framework, much like how complex numbers encompass both real and imaginary components to form a 
        complete picture.

Further Explanation

    observer_position:
        Role: Represents the current spatial position of the observer in the simulation along 
            a one-dimensional axis.
        Calculation: Incremented or decremented by 1 unit with each 'right' or 'left' input, 
            simulating movement towards or away from the target in spacetime.
        
    target_position:
        Role: Denotes the destination or target point in spacetime that the observer aims 
            to reach.
        Calculation: Set by user input at the start and remains constant, serving as the 
            fixed point towards which the observer moves.
   
    observerA_spacetime_traveled:
        Role: Accumulates the total spacetime distance traveled by Observer A, taking into 
            account the effects of time dilation as they move towards a stronger gravitational field.
        Calculation: Updated with each movement based on observerA_time_dilation_rate, 
            reflecting the slowed progression through spacetime due to gravity.
    
    observerA_time_dilation_rate: *** PRIMARY FORMULA ***
        Role: Determines the rate at which time dilates for Observer A as they move towards or away 
            from the target, simulating the influence of gravity on their passage through spacetime.
        Calculation: (target_position - observerA_spacetime_traveled) / (curr_distance + 1), 
            which adjusts the observer's pace based on their remaining distance to the target and 
            simulates time dilation.
    
    observerB_time_contraction_rate:
        Role: Represents the rate of time contraction for Observer B, moving in the opposite conceptual 
            direction to Observer A and experiencing faster progression through spacetime.
        Calculation: 1 / observerA_time_dilation_rate, the reciprocal of Observer A's time dilation 
            rate, illustrating the inverse relationship between time dilation and contraction.
    
    observerB_spacetime_traveled:
        Role: Tracks the total spacetime distance covered by Observer B, accounting for the effects of 
            time contraction as they move away from stronger gravity.
        Calculation: Incremented by observerB_time_contraction_rate with each 'left' movement, 
            reflecting the accelerated progression through spacetime.
    
    your_spacetime_traveled:
        Role: Measures the spacetime distance you, as the program's user and the third observer, have 
            traversed during the simulation.
        Calculation: Incremented by 1 unit with each input ('left' or 'right'), representing your 
            steady progression through spacetime at a constant rate.
    
    observerB_extended_target:
        Role: For Observer B, this variable signifies the extended target position in spacetime, 
            considering the expanded spacetime they traverse due to time contraction.
        Calculation: observerB_spacetime_traveled + (observerB_time_contraction_rate**2) 
                    * (target_position - observerA_spacetime_traveled), 
            which accounts for the additional spacetime distance resulting from 
            Observer B's faster movement through spacetime.

Final Conceptual of Code

    This program simulates the relativistic effects of gravity on spacetime by conceptually manipulating 
    a hypotenuse — representing the path or timeline towards a target point. The core mechanism is to 
    adjust the rate at which this hypotenuse is traversed, reflecting time dilation or contraction 
    experienced due to gravity.

    Observer A (Approaching Gravity):
        Mechanism: Each 'left' movement symbolizes a step towards a stronger gravitational field, 
            effectively 'stretching' spacetime.
        Calculation: The observerA_time_dilation_rate is determined by fitting the adjusted distance 
            to the target into the remaining distance along the hypotenuse. This effectively 'slows down' 
            the rate of traversal, simulating time dilation.
        Example: If the target is 10 units away and Observer A moves 'left', their perspective shifts to 
            being 10 units away again, but the rate at which they cover these units slows down. If they 
            were 1 unit away from the target and moved 'left', their new rate of 0.8181 (approx.) reflects 
            a slower progression, as now they need to fit 10 steps into what appears as 9 units, plus the 
            step taken.

    Observer B (Moving Away from Gravity):
        Mechanism: Conceptually, when Observer A moves 'left', Observer B is moving away from gravity, 
            experiencing spacetime 'contraction'.
        Calculation: The observerB_time_contraction_rate is the reciprocal of Observer A's rate, 
            indicating a quicker traversal of spacetime, as the distance to the target point stretches but 
            must still fit within the original distance.
        Example: If the target is 10 units away and Observer B's movement implies they are now 11 units 
            away, their progression rate increases. Their faster rate of 1.22222 means they cover more ground 
            in spacetime, fitting what is now perceived as 12.22222 units into the original 10-step journey 
            towards the target.
